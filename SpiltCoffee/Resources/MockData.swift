        The case against Uber: City officials accuse ride-hailers of 1) eviscerating the yellow taxi industry and 2) clogging NYC's streets.
        
        Let's dive in.
        
        Gripe #1: While Uber's exploded in NYC, the classic yellow taxis have suffered.
        
        Take the price of a medallion, for example (what's required to operate a yellow cab). In 2013, they went for $1.3 million. Now? They're being sold for as low as $160,000.
        Six professional drivers have committed suicide since December.
        Gripe #2: Congestion. NYC has a traffic problem, and according to a recent study by transportation guru Bruce Schaller, ride-hailers are making the problem worse, not better.
        
        If ride-hailers weren't available, ~60% of users in large, dense cities would have either walked, biked, taken public transportation...or not traveled at all.
        Ride-hailers account for an overall 160% increase in driving on city streets.
        Uber's fighting back
        Here's what Josh Gold, a spokesman for Uber, had to say:
        
        Not only will the cap "leave New Yorkers stranded while doing nothing to prevent congestion," it'll hurt riders "who have come to rely on Uber because their communities have long been ignored by yellow taxis and do not have reliable access to public transit."
        One potential Uber ally: Vocal members of New York's black community, who do feel like they've been ignored by yellow taxis due to racial bias.
        
        Don't live in New York? You should still care
        As Frank Sinatra once sang about the city, "If I can make it there, I'm gonna make it anywhere." And we're pretty sure he was talking about ride-hailing regulation.
        
        Meaning, as other major cities around the world try to deal with the Uber phenomenon, they might look to NYC, the U.S.' most populous city, as a laboratory for reining in ride-hailers.
